/**
 * Represents a set of transformations supported by the Transform Service that share the same transform options. Each
 * may be an actual transformer or the amalgamation of multiple transformers. It is possible that more than one
 * transformer may able to perform a transformation from one mimetype to another. The actual selection of transformer
 * is up to the Transform Service to decide. Clients may use TransformServiceRegistry#isSupported to decide
 * if they should send a request to the Transform Service. As a result clients have a simple generic view of
 * transformations which allows new transformations to be added without the need change client data structures other
 * than to define new name value pairs. For this to work the Transform Service defines unique names for each option.
 * <ul>
 *     <lI>name - is unique. The client should infer nothing from the name as it is simply a label.</lI>
 *     <li>version - of the transformer. The client should infer nothing from the value and should only use it
 *     in messages. There should only be one version supplied to the client for each name.</li>
 *     <li>transformOptions - a grouping of individual transformer transformOptions. The group may be optional and may
 *     contain nested transformOptions.</li>
 * </ul>
